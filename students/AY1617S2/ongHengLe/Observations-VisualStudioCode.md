# Encouraging Public Contributions to PowerPointLabs

*Author: Ong Heng Le*

Due to differences in scale and demographics of users, my experiences in contributing to Visual Studio Code differed from that of PowerPointLabs. Visual Studio Code gave me the experience of working in an open-source project, where contributors follow a standard and make minimal changes so that merge conflicts for other contributors are reduced.

#### Things I have learnt from contributing to Visual Studio Code

* Keep changes to a minimum, and use Interface to keep the code base organized
* Clarify assumptions and the solution with the person who opened the issue early
* Do not be intimidated by the fear of disapproval from reviewers
* Reviewers can be helpful and have patience to guide new contributors in improving their code
* Having concise coding guidelines reduces the barriers to entry for contributing 

PowerPointLabs, on the other hand, allowed frequent changes to the file structures and workflow. Although this is an indication of flexibility, it may not be sustainable in the long run for a large open-source project. This may be due to the developers becoming too comfortable with  majority being a member of PowerPointLabs team and treating it as an "internal project" rather than an open-source project.

Hence, we should draw public contributions so that the false impressions as an "internal project" are eliminated and a firm standard is followed. Some strategies are suggested below.

### 1. Show the benefits of contributing to PowerPointLabs

The benefits of contributing to PowerPointLabs should be made more noticeable. Visual Studio Code provides obvious incentives for contributors, such as the beliefs that their contributions benefit millions of users and that their codes are acknowledged by Microsoft employees. 

The same statement, however, may be more difficult to apply to PowerPointLabs. Therefore, PowerPointLabs should target a specific audience (e.g. computing students) and list the potential benefits for contributing on its GitHub page, such as: 

* Reach out to more than 300,000 people who has benefitted from PowerPointLabs
* Gain experiences and technical knowledge in developing for a PowerPoint add-in and C#
* Build up your portfolio with open-source code which is visible and verifiable

### 2. Use tools to engage and motivate contributors

#### Use Gitter to provide support and discussions for developers

PowerPointLabs should use [Gitter](https://gitter.im), a chat room system for GitHub repositories, to make contributors feel engaged when developing for PowerPointLabs. Visual Studio Code has a Gitter badge on its GitHub page, and many developers actively ask and answer questions in Visual Studio Code's Gitter chat room. These interactions may lead to a more active and retaining developer community for PowerPointLabs.

#### Use Mention Bot to ensure that all pull requests are assigned

Pull requests (PRs), especially those from the public, should never go unnoticed. Visual Studio Code tries to prevent this with the help of [Mention Bot](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot), which automatically mentions potential reviewers for PRs. This provides a confirmation to the contributor, and also fairly assigns responsibilities to reviewers.

### 3. Actively call for contributions

The users of Visual Studio Code are likely to be familiar with Git and actively seek to contribute to open-source projects. This differs from the demographics of PowerPointLabs users, who may be less concerned with coding and Git. 

PowerPointLabs should not wait passively for public contributions, and should instead seek for them actively. Here are some possible ways to call for contributions to PowerPointLabs:

* Put up posters around School of Computing in NUS and other universities/polytechnics
* Give talks to computing students to inform them of the benefits
